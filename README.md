# FiveM Server Launcher (FLG-RP)

#Installation instructions.
I decided to release the source files to a quick launcher I made for FLG, reason being I couldnt find anything that was freely available for the FiveM community to use, it has functionality to open FiveM, open a website and open CAD/MDT (just another website link button)

The launcher is simple to edit to your needs.

Instructions
 - Click __Download__, then download the zip, extract the zip.
 
 - Open `FLG-RP Launcher.sin` with Visual Studio Code
 
 - You'll want to change the background image, application icon, `play FLG-RP` button text, button redirects as seen here (https://imgur.com/a/3MVHiEp). Basically change all `FLG-RP`/`FLG-RP Launcher` to [Youre server name] 
 
 # Update Changelog
 __Version 1.1__
  
  - Changed button ui, now looks more modern
  - Removed progress bars, cleaner ui
  - Properly centered the buttons on the bottom
  - Added minimum size to prevent ui overlap
  
 __Version 1.0__ 
   - __Play FLG-RP__ will launch fivem and directly connect 
   - __CAD/MDT__ will launch your default browser into FLG's CAD website
   - __View website__ will launch the website/forum
